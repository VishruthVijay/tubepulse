/**

 * The Apify ingest learned this the hard way: a second inlined copy diverged and
 * only reproduced on one machine. So: one module, imported everywhere.
 *
 * EVERY WRITE IN HERE USES THE SERVICE-ROLE CLIENT, and that is not a shortcut.
 * `subscriptions` and `scrape_credits` deliberately have a select policy and no
 * insert, update or delete policy at all — if a browser's own credentials could
 * write them, a user could grant themselves Pro with one request. So the tables
 * are unwritable by design and this module is the only door, reached only after
 * a Razorpay signature has been verified or Razorpay's own API has confirmed the
 * payment.
 *
 * This is the exception the AGENTS.md rule names, not a hole in it. Reaching for
 * the admin client anywhere else still means an RLS policy is missing.
 *
 * Reads are the opposite: they use the caller's session so RLS decides what is
 * visible, which is why a user can only ever see their own row.
