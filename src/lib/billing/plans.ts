/**
 * The plan catalogue — the ONE place any pricing number is written down.
 *
 * The pricing page, the billing page, the Razorpay plan-creation script and the
 * quota checks all read from here. Previously these numbers lived only in the
 * marketing copy, which is how a page ends up promising 30 scrapes while the
 * plan charges for 15.
 *
 * Pure module, no imports, no environment. Safe from a client component.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CURRENCY IS INR, INDIA ONLY. Changed 2026-09-11.
 *
 * The product previously priced in USD globally. That is still the intended
 * destination — but USD subscriptions need a payment path this business does
 * not yet have:
 *
 *   * Razorpay Subscriptions refuses USD until International Payments is
 *     approved. Verified against the live account: a USD plan returns
 *     "Currency provided is not supported" while an INR plan is created fine.
 *   * PayPal's own Subscriptions API needs Reference Transactions enabled on
 *     the merchant account, which PayPal does not grant by default.
 *
 * Both are pending. Rather than wait, the product sells to India in INR now.
 * WHEN EITHER APPROVAL LANDS, THIS FILE GOES BACK TO USD — see the USD ladder
 * preserved at the bottom of this comment, and keep the two in step.
 *
 * ALLOWANCES SHRANK WITH THE PRICE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
 * The previous version of this comment warned that INR pricing at USD
 * allowances is negative margin, and it was right: Studio at Rs 1299 for the
 * old 60 runs is MINUS 28% on a promoted annual. Rupee prices therefore buy
 * rupee-sized allowances. This is the "two products wearing the same tier
 * names" problem the old note predicted — accepted deliberately, because the
 * alternative is charging Indian customers $49.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ECONOMICS. Do not "improve" these numbers without redoing this sum.
 * `tests/billing-status.test.ts` fails if any of it stops holding.
 *
 * WHAT ONE UNIT OF THE ALLOWANCE BUYS. `runs` counts every billable action: a
 * channel scrape, a generation of ideas from a channel already scraped, or a
 * transcript extraction. All cost real money per press, so all spend a unit —
 * see BILLABLE_JOB_KINDS in quota.ts.
 *
 * COST PER RUN depends on the model tier, which is a PLAN FEATURE:
 *
 *   Mini-tier model (Scout, Creator)
 *     Apify        Rs 4.50
 *     Firecrawl    Rs 1.50
 *     LLM          Rs 0.40
 *     ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *     Total        Rs 6.40
 *
 *   Premium model (Studio, Max)
 *     Apify        Rs 4.50
 *     Firecrawl    Rs 1.50
 *     LLM          Rs 6.00
 *     ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *     Total        Rs 12.00
 *
 * An INSTAGRAM run costs about Rs 9.50 in Apify alone — 4-6x YouTube's rate,
 * measured at $0.0027 an item. That is why `postsPerRun` is smaller than
 * `videosPerRun`, and why Instagram is gated to Studio and above: the depth
 * moves and the tier moves, the price does not.
 *
 * Whisper voice transcription adds ~Rs 0.26 per voice-initiated request.
 * Assumed at 50% of runs in the sums below, which is generous.
 *
 * RAZORPAY DOMESTIC takes 2% plus 18% GST on the fee — 2.36% of the charge.
 * That is the number these sums use, and it is LOWER than the 3.54% the
 * international path cost. Selling only in India is cheaper to collect.
 *
 * THE WORST CASE IS NOT THE MONTHLY PRICE. It is the yearly price with the
 * launch promo applied, spread across twelve months — the least revenue a
 * month of usage will ever earn. Every allowance is sized against THAT:
 *
 *   Creator  Rs 499/mo   -> Rs 4,990/yr,  20% off -> 76% margin
 *   Studio   Rs 1,299/mo -> Rs 12,990/yr, 20% off -> 54% margin
 *   Max      Rs 3,499/mo -> Rs 34,990/yr, 20% off -> 52% margin
 *
 * At the monthly sticker price with no promo those become 84% / 69% / 68%.
 *
 * WHY CREATOR GIVES ONLY 12 RUNS, which looks mean next to the old 20.
 * The pricing page badges Studio "best value", and a test enforces that the
 * badge is TRUE: Studio must cost less per run than Creator. Studio runs the
 * PREMIUM model at Rs 12/run against Creator's Rs 6.40, and at 50% margin a
 * premium tier cannot be cheaper than about Rs 37 a run. Creator at 15 runs
 * priced itself at Rs 33 a run — BELOW that floor — which made the badge
 * arithmetically impossible and left Studio dearer per run than the tier
 * beneath it. Twelve runs puts Creator at Rs 41.6 and restores the ladder:
 * 41.6 -> 40.6 -> 38.9, falling at every step. It still covers the solo
 * creator band (10-16 runs), which is the segment it is for.
 *
 * THE LAUNCH PROMO IS A FLAT 20%, not the old tiered 30/40/50. At rupee prices
 * the tiered version took Max to roughly 30% worst case, which is too thin for
 * a tier whose per-run costs are real. One rate is also one sentence to
 * explain. The code is LAUNCH20.
 *
 * ALLOWANCES ARE SIZED TO REAL HUMAN USAGE, NOT TO THE MARGIN CEILING.
 * This is the important design rule and it is easy to get wrong. An allowance
 * far above what a segment can physically consume is not generosity — it is a
 * broken ladder, because nobody ever has a reason to upgrade. Measured usage:
 *
 *   Solo creator, 1 channel, posts 1-2x/week      10-16 runs a month
 *   Serious creator, 1-3 channels, posts 3x/week  28-44 runs a month
 *   Power user, many channels at once             85-140 runs a month
 *
 * Creator's 12 fits a solo creator and runs out the moment they take on a
 * second channel. Studio's 32 covers a serious creator and runs out well before
 * power-user volume. Max's 90 reaches into the power-user band. Each tier ends
 * inside the next segment's floor, which is what makes the ladder real rather
 * than decorative.
 *
 * RAISING AN ALLOWANCE WITHOUT RAISING ITS PRICE BREAKS THE LADDER, not just
 * the margin — and on this ladder it also breaks the "best value" badge, which
 * is checked by a test rather than trusted.
 *
 * FREE costs real money too: every free run is spend on somebody who may never
 * pay. Three runs a month on the mini model is about Rs 20 per signup per
 * month — cheap enough to leave recurring rather than one-time, which keeps
 * people in the product long enough to convert.
 *
 * THE DAILY CAP IS DELIBERATELY BELOW runs/3, so a month cannot be drained in
 * under three days. It is a spend guard, not a burst limit.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE USD LADDER, PRESERVED FOR THE SWITCH BACK.
 *
 * When International Payments or Reference Transactions is approved, restore:
 *
 *   Creator  $19  20 runs  100 videos/run   5/day
 *   Studio   $49  60 runs  150 videos/run  40 posts  15/day
 *   Max      $89  150 runs 200 videos/run  60 posts  35/day
 *
 * Those allowances are affordable at USD prices and were sized by the same
 * method. Switching back means this file, `formatMoney`, the currency sent by
 * `scripts/create-razorpay-plan.mjs`, and six new Razorpay plan objects.
