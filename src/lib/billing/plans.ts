/**
 * The plan catalogue — the ONE place any pricing number is written down.
 *
 * The pricing page, the billing page, the Razorpay plan-creation script and the
 * quota checks all read from here. Previously these numbers lived only in the
 * marketing copy, which is how a page ends up promising 30 scrapes while the
 * plan charges for 15.
 *
 * Pure module, no imports, no environment. Safe from a client component.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CURRENCY IS USD, GLOBALLY. There is no regional pricing.
 *
 * This was considered and rejected. INR pricing that Indian customers would
 * actually pay (₹499) cannot fund US-level allowances — at ₹499 for 50 runs on
 * a promoted annual the margin is NEGATIVE 12%. Regional pricing therefore
 * means regional allowances, i.e. two different products wearing the same tier
 * names. One global price is the simpler, more honest thing, and it is what
 * this file implements. Indian customers will find $19 expensive; that is a
 * known and accepted trade.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ECONOMICS. Do not "improve" these numbers without redoing this sum.
 * `tests/billing-status.test.ts` fails if any of it stops holding.
 *
 * WHAT ONE UNIT OF THE ALLOWANCE BUYS. `runs` counts every billable action: a
 * channel scrape, a generation of ideas from a channel already scraped, or a
 * transcript extraction. All cost real money per press, so all spend a unit —
 * see BILLABLE_JOB_KINDS in quota.ts.
 *
 * COST PER RUN depends on the model tier, which is now a PLAN FEATURE:
 *
 *   Mini-tier model (Scout, Creator)
 *     Apify        ₹4.50
 *     Firecrawl    ₹1.50
 *     LLM          ₹0.40
 *     ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *     Total        ₹6.40   ≈ $0.073 at ₹88/$
 *
 *   Premium model (Studio, Max)
 *     Apify        ₹4.50
 *     Firecrawl    ₹1.50
 *     LLM          ₹6.00
 *     ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *     Total        ₹12.00  ≈ $0.136 at ₹88/$
 *
 * An INSTAGRAM run costs about ₹9.50 in Apify alone — 4-6x YouTube's rate,
 * measured at $0.0027 an item. That is why `postsPerRun` is smaller than
 * `videosPerRun`, and why Instagram is gated to Studio and above: the depth
 * moves and the tier moves, the price does not.
 *
 * Whisper voice transcription adds ~$0.003 per voice-initiated request. Assumed
 * at 50% of runs in the sums below, which is generous.
 *
 * Razorpay international takes ~3% plus 18% GST — 3.54% of whatever is charged.
 * This is HIGHER than the 2.36% domestic rate the old INR pricing assumed.
 *
 * THE WORST CASE IS NOT THE MONTHLY PRICE. It is the yearly price with the
 * 30%-off first-year promo applied, spread across twelve months — that is the
 * least revenue a month of usage will ever earn. Every allowance below is
 * sized against THAT number, not the sticker price:
 *
 *   Creator  $19/mo → $133/yr promoted → $11.08/mo effective → 83% margin
 *   Studio   $49/mo → $343/yr promoted → $28.58/mo effective → 68% margin
 *   Max      $89/mo → $623/yr promoted → $51.92/mo effective → 57% margin
 *
 * ALLOWANCES ARE SIZED TO REAL HUMAN USAGE, NOT TO THE MARGIN CEILING.
 * This is the important design rule and it is easy to get wrong. An allowance
 * far above what a segment can physically consume is not generosity — it is a
 * broken ladder, because nobody ever has a reason to upgrade. Measured usage:
 *
 *   Solo creator, 1 channel, posts 1-2x/week      10-16 runs a month
 *   Serious creator, 1-3 channels, posts 3x/week  28-44 runs a month
 *   Power user, many channels at once             85-140 runs a month
 *
 * So each tier's allowance sits just above its own segment's ceiling and below
 * the next segment's floor. Creator's 20 comfortably fits a solo creator and
 * runs out the moment they scale to three channels. Studio's 60 fits a serious
 * creator and runs out at power-user volume. That is what makes the ladder
 * real rather than decorative.
 *
 * RAISING AN ALLOWANCE WITHOUT RAISING ITS PRICE BREAKS THE LADDER, not just
 * the margin. If Creator gave 50 runs, no solo creator would ever need Studio,
 * and the middle tier would exist only to be ignored.
 *
 * FREE costs real money too: every free run is spend on somebody who may never
 * pay. Three runs a month on the mini model is about $0.22 per signup per
 * month — cheap enough to leave recurring rather than one-time, which keeps
 * people in the product long enough to convert.
 *
 * THE DAILY CAP IS DELIBERATELY BELOW runs/3, so a month cannot be drained in
 * under three days. It is a spend guard, not a burst limit.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
