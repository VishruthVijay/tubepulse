/**
 * Promo codes — the arithmetic and the rules, with no database in sight.
 *
 * Pure module, unit tested, because discount code bugs are expensive in both
 * directions: too little and a customer is overcharged after being promised a
 * price, too much and you are giving the product away to anyone who guesses a
 * word. Neither shows up in a typecheck.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE AWKWARD PART, and it is Razorpay's design rather than ours.
 *
 * A Razorpay plan hard-codes its amount, and a subscription bills that plan —
 * there is no "charge $105 this once" parameter. The only supported route is a
 * Razorpay **Offer**, created in their dashboard, whose `offer_id` is passed
 * when the subscription is created.
 *
 * So a subscription promo needs TWO things that must agree: a row here, and an
 * offer in the Razorpay dashboard. `razorpayOfferId` is what links them, and a
 * subscription promo without one is rejected loudly rather than silently
 * charging full price after showing a discount. Being told "this code cannot be
 * used yet" is survivable; being charged $150 after seeing $105 is not.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE FIRST-YEAR TRAP. Read this before creating any launch code.
 *
 * A Razorpay Offer attached to a subscription applies to EVERY billing cycle of
 * that subscription unless the offer itself is created with a cycle limit. The
 * dashboard does not warn you. So the obvious way to build "30% off your first
 * year" produces "30% off every year, forever" — and nobody notices until the
 * second renewal, by which time the discount is a contractual expectation.
 *
 * `appliesToCycles` records what the offer was actually configured with. It is
 * NOT a thing this code enforces — it cannot, the enforcement lives at Razorpay
 * — it is a written-down claim about the offer, so that:
 *
 *   1. The checkout page can honestly say "renews at $150/yr after the first
 *      year" rather than staying quiet about it.
 *   2. A code whose author never thought about renewals is rejected instead of
 *      quietly becoming a lifetime discount.
 *
 * A `firstCycleOnly` code REQUIRES a `renewsAtPaise` so the disclosure has a
 * number to show. That pairing is the whole safety mechanism.
