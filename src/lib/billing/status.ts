/**
 * Turning a subscription row into the two things the app actually asks:
 * "which plan is this person on?" and "what do I put on the screen?".
 *
 * Pure — no database, no network — so the rules that decide who gets paid
 * features are unit tested rather than inferred from a page render.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT MATTERS: access is not the same as status. Someone who cancels
 * on the 2nd has paid through the 30th and keeps their tier until then. The
 * pricing page promises exactly that, so access checks the period end, not the
 * word "cancelled".
 *
 * WHICH TIER, NOT WHETHER PAID. The old version answered a boolean, which was
 * enough when there was one paid plan. With four, every quota and feature check
 * needs the actual key, so `planKey` is the primary output and `isPaid` is
 * derived from it.
