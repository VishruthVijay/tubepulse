 *   channel   they named someone specific — "@mkbhd", "research Veritasium"
 *   niche     they described a subject — "fitness for beginners over 40"
 *   unclear   neither, or so vague that any research would be a guess
 *
 * A CHANNEL SKIPS DISCOVERY ENTIRELY. Someone who named a channel has already
 * done the hard part, and running a discovery pass over their answer would
 * spend a model call to rediscover what they just said.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE CLARIFYING QUESTION IS RATIONED, deliberately.
 *
 * At most one, and only when the answer would change what gets scraped. The
 * rule is not "ask when unsure" — a model asked to be careful will ask about
 * everything, and a product that interrogates you before every run is worse
 * than one that occasionally researches the wrong thing.
 *
 * "Fitness" is worth a question: YouTube and Instagram give different answers.
 * "Fitness for beginners over 40 on YouTube" is not — it is already an answer.

Work out what to research.

- "channel" means they named a specific account: a handle like @mkbhd, a URL, or a name like "Veritasium" or "Marques Brownlee". Put the handle or name in "channel", without a leading @.
- "niche" means they described a subject rather than an account — "fitness for beginners over 40", "indie game devs", "home espresso". Put a cleaned version in "niche": keep their words, drop the filler ("um", "I want to look at", "can you find me").
- "unclear" means neither. A request with no subject at all.

"platform" is "youtube" or "instagram" ONLY if they said so, or pasted a URL that says so. Otherwise null. Never infer it from the subject.

"question" is at most ONE short question, and only when the answer would change WHICH accounts get researched. Almost always null.
  Ask: a bare niche with no platform, where the two platforms would give genuinely different accounts.
  Do NOT ask: to confirm something they already said; to narrow a niche that is already specific; about anything that does not change what gets scraped.

"confidence" is 0-100: how sure you are that researching this would give them what they asked for. A named channel is near 100. A clear niche is 70-90. A one-word request is 20-40.

Return a JSON object of exactly this shape:
