 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * BOTH CALLS RUN ON THE MINI MODEL, WHATEVER THE PLAN.
 *
 * Reading "fitness for beginners over 40" out of a sentence is not the hard
 * part of this product, and neither is naming six fitness channels. The premium
 * model is what Studio and Max pay for on IDEA GENERATION, where reasoning
 * quality actually shows. Spending it here would double the cost of a step
 * whose output is then verified against Apify anyway.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EVERY CANDIDATE IS VERIFIED BEFORE IT IS OFFERED.
 *
 * A model asked for real handles will still invent one occasionally, and an
 * invented handle costs a user a run to discover — they pick it, it scrapes
 * nothing, and the product looks broken. So each candidate is checked against
 * Apify's own resolution before it reaches the screen, and anything that does
 * not resolve is dropped silently rather than shown with a warning.
