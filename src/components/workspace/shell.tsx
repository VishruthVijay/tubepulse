/**
 * The workspace shell: sidebar and the page itself.
 *
 * There WAS a third column here holding a voice agent. It is gone, and the
 * reasoning is in docs/decisions/0005: typing a channel URL was never the hard
 * part, so a voice layer on top solved nothing while billing by the minute
 * against a product priced by the scrape. Removing it gives the page back
 * roughly 400px, which is the difference between a readable data table and a
 * cramped one.
 *
 * Client component only because of the drawer's open state and the desktop
 * collapse; the pages rendered inside `children` stay server components and do
 * their own queries under RLS.
 *
 * TWO SEPARATE PIECES OF STATE, deliberately. `navOpen` is the mobile drawer,
 * which is transient and always starts shut. `collapsed` is the desktop rail,
 * which is a remembered preference. Merging them would mean a phone inheriting
 * a choice made on a desktop, on a layout where the sidebar is a drawer and
 * "collapsed" means nothing.
