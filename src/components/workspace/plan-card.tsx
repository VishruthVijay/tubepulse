/**
 * The sidebar's plan-and-usage card.
 *
 * Answers, without leaving the page you are on: what am I paying for, how much
 * of it have I used, when does it reset, and is anything about to stop. Those
 * questions previously required navigating to /billing, which meant the answer
 * to "why did that run fail?" lived one click away from the failure.
 *
 * A SERVER COMPONENT, deliberately. Every number here comes from `getQuota()`,
 * which counts jobs under RLS. Fetching it in the browser would put the
 * allowance behind a spinner on every page load and let a client decide what a
 * user's plan is — the one thing the billing code is careful never to do.
 *
 * IT RENDERS NOTHING WITHOUT A QUOTA. A missing quota means the layout could
 * not read one, and inventing "0 of 3" would be a lie on the way to a support
 * ticket.
