/**
 * What happens AFTER the discount, stated where the customer cannot miss it.
 *
 * This is the component that turns a promo from a marketing line into an
 * informed agreement. A two-month discount on a subscription has a cliff: the
 * third invoice is 40-50% higher than the first two, and a customer who
 * discovers that on their statement is right to be angry no matter what the
 * terms page said.
 *
 * So this is deliberately NOT dim, NOT small and NOT collapsed. The pattern it
 * refuses is the one every dark-pattern checkout uses — a bright discounted
 * price and a grey renewal clause. Card networks treat an undisclosed renewal
 * as a chargeback risk, and the customer being sure of what they signed up for
 * is the whole point of taking the card before the discount ends.
 *
 * It renders nothing when there is nothing to disclose (a forever discount, or
 * a code with no cliff), because a reassurance nobody needs is noise.
