/**
 * The upgrade flow, in one place.
 *
 * Two buttons open Razorpay — the shadcn one on the billing page and the
 * magnetic one on the pricing page — and they must behave identically. The
 * Apify ingest already taught this project what happens when the same procedure
 * is written twice: the copies drift and only one machine reproduces the bug.
 * So the visuals differ and the logic does not.
 *
 * THE FLOW, and why each step exists:
 *
 *   1. POST /api/billing/checkout — the SERVER creates the subscription. The
 *      browser never states what it is paying for, or it would ask for ₹1.
 *   2. Razorpay's popup takes the autopay authorisation. No card or UPI detail
 *      touches this codebase, which is the whole point of using a gateway.
 *   3. POST /api/billing/sync on success. Their handler fires the moment the
 *      mandate is approved — usually before the webhook lands, and on localhost
 *      the webhook never lands at all. This is what makes the page say "Pro"
 *      straight away instead of looking broken.
 *
 * The success payload is deliberately not trusted to grant anything: it is a
 * message from a browser. Step 3 asks Razorpay's own API instead.
