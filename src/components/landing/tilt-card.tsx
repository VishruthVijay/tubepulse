/**
 * A glass panel that tilts in 3D toward the cursor.
 *
 * Real perspective, not a scale-up pretending to be depth: the card rotates on
 * two axes, a specular highlight tracks the pointer across its surface, and the
 * children can be pushed forward on the Z axis with `data-depth` so the panel
 * has actual layers rather than one flat face.
 *
 * All transform and custom-property writes — no layout, no paint of anything
 * expensive — so it stays smooth on a laptop trackpad.
