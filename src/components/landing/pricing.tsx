/**
 * The pricing page.
 *
 * PAYMENTS ARE LIVE. "Go Pro" opens Razorpay and sets up a real monthly autopay
 * mandate. Quota enforcement is NOT built yet — the app still counts no scrapes
 * — so today a subscriber pays for a promise the code does not police. That is
 * the next piece of work, and it is deliberately separate: mixing "may they
 * pay" with "have they run out" would make both harder to verify.
 *
 * EVERY NUMBER ON THIS PAGE COMES FROM `lib/billing/plans.ts`. Nothing here is
 * typed as a literal, because the previous version of this file promised 30
 * scrapes for ₹399 while the intended plan was 15 for ₹499 — and a marketing
 * page that contradicts the charge is not a copy problem, it is a refund. The
 * economics behind the numbers are written up in that same file.
 *
 * REFILL PACKS are a SEPARATE Razorpay product — one-off Orders, no mandate —
 * with their own route, their own webhook event and their own ledger table.
 * They are priced ABOVE the Pro per-scrape rate on purpose, and the page shows
 * that arithmetic rather than asserting it: a refill that undercuts the plan
 * teaches people to cancel the plan.
 *
 * WHAT IS WIRED
 *   POST /api/billing/checkout     creates the subscription
 *   POST /api/webhooks/razorpay    signature-checked, decides who is Pro
 *   POST /api/billing/sync         polling fallback, same as the Apify job
 *   POST /api/billing/cancel       cancels the mandate at Razorpay first
 *   POST /api/billing/topup        creates a one-off order for a refill pack
 *   POST /api/billing/topup/confirm  verifies it, then grants the credits
 *   /billing                       the signed-in management screen

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What exactly is one run?",
    a: `One billable action: a full pull of a channel's catalogue — up to ${PRO.videosPerRun} videos on ${PRO.name}, scored — or a generation of ideas from a channel already pulled, or a transcript. All three cost real money to run, so all three count. Re-running the same channel next month counts again, because it is genuinely another pull.`,
  },
  {
    q: `Why ${PRO.runs} runs and not five hundred?`,
    a: `Because every run spends real money at Apify and OpenAI, and a number we cannot afford is a number we would quietly claw back later through worse results. The allowances are sized to what each kind of creator actually gets through in a month — ${PLANS.creator.runs} for one channel, ${PLANS.studio.runs} for a few, ${PLANS.agency.runs} for tracking a whole field at once.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Why is there a daily cap on a paid plan?",
    a: `The same reason your AI subscription has one. ${PRO.name} allows ${PRO.dailyCap} runs a day inside the monthly ${PRO.runs}, so one enthusiastic afternoon cannot drain the month. Every tier has a cap sized to its own allowance. It is on this page rather than in an email you get afterwards.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Is yearly actually cheaper?",
    a: `Yes, by ${yearlySavingPercent()}% — ${formatUsd(PLAN_PRICES[HIGHLIGHTED_PLAN].yearly.priceUsd)} for the year against ${formatUsd(PLAN_PRICES[HIGHLIGHTED_PLAN].monthly.priceUsd * 12)} paid monthly. Twelve months for the price of ten. The page shows both the per-month figure and the amount that actually leaves your account, because quoting only the first is how people get surprised at checkout.`,
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between the models?",
    a: `${PLANS.creator.name} runs a fast model built for volume — quick, cheap, and good at finding patterns. ${PLANS.studio.name} and ${PLANS.agency.name} run an advanced reasoning model that is noticeably better on ambiguous niches, where the right angle is not obvious from the titles alone. It is stated here rather than discovered later.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Why is Instagram only on the higher tiers?",
    a: `Because Instagram data costs four to six times what YouTube data costs, per item. Putting it on every tier would mean cutting everyone's allowance to pay for it. It sits on ${PLANS.studio.name} and ${PLANS.agency.name}, where the price covers it honestly.`,
  },
  {
    q: "How do I pay?",
    a: "Razorpay — cards, UPI Autopay, netbanking or wallets. It renews itself until you stop it. Card details are entered in Razorpay's own window and never reach us.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do unused runs roll over?",
    a: "No, and pretending otherwise would be the kind of small print this page is trying to avoid. The monthly allowance resets on your billing date.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I change plans later?",
    a: `Yes, in both directions, from the billing page. Moving up takes effect when the new plan starts; moving down leaves you on what you paid for until that period ends. Nothing is lost either way — your projects and saved ideas are yours regardless of tier.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Can I cancel?",
    a: `Any time, from the billing page, in two clicks. That also switches off the autopay mandate at Razorpay, so nothing further can be charged — you are never asked to cancel the same thing twice. You keep your plan until the period you already paid for runs out, then your projects and saved ideas stay readable on ${FREE.name}.`,
