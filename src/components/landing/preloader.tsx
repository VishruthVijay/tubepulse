/**
 * The loading screen.
 *
 * An honest one. The counter is driven by real progress events — fonts becoming
 * ready, the window load event — not a fake timer that always takes 2.4
 * seconds. That matters here for the same reason it matters on the job progress
 * bar in the workspace: the product's whole pitch is evidence over vibes, and a
 * fabricated progress bar is the smallest possible lie to open with.
 *
 * What is choreographed is the exit: once real work is done, the counter
 * finishes, holds for a beat, and the panels split away.
