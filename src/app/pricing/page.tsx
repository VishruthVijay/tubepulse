 * The public pricing page.
 *
 * Shares the landing page's client islands, minus the Preloader — the intro
 * curtain belongs to the front door only. Someone arriving here from the nav
 * has already seen it, and replaying it on every route would be theatre.
 *
 * Payments ARE wired — see the note at the top of
 * `components/landing/pricing.tsx`. This page reads the visitor's subscription
 * so the Pro card can say "Your plan" rather than trying to sell it to someone
 * who already bought it. Which means it must never be cached.
