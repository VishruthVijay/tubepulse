/**
 * POST /api/agent — turn a spoken request into something researchable.
 *
 * The step between "say the niche" and a scrape. It reads what was asked for,
 * and either hands back a channel to research, a short list of candidates, or
 * one question.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IT SPENDS NO ALLOWANCE, and that is the point of the feature.
 *
 * Two mini-model calls cost a fraction of a cent between them. Charging a run
 * for working out what someone meant would mean rephrasing a request costs the
 * same as researching a channel — and people would stop speaking to it, which
 * is the one behaviour this whole feature exists to encourage.
 *
 * The scrape that FOLLOWS is billed normally, by /api/research, with every
 * quota and gate it already has. Nothing here bypasses that.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOTHING IS SCRAPED HERE EITHER. This route only ever proposes. The person
 * picks, and the existing research route does the work — so a misheard request
 * costs a moment rather than a run.
