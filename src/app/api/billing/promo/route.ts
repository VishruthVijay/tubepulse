/**
 * POST /api/billing/promo — check a code and price it, without charging.
 *
 * Preview only. Whatever this returns is for showing a struck-through price;
 * it grants nothing, and checkout re-runs the identical check server-side
 * rather than trusting the figure the browser was handed. A code can expire or
 * be fully claimed in the seconds between the two calls, and the request to
 * this endpoint could have been made by anyone.
 *
 * Requires a session, so that once-per-person can be evaluated — and so the
 * endpoint cannot be used anonymously to brute-force code names.
 *
 * The amount is derived from the named product, never sent by the client. A
 * body that could say `amountPaise: 100000` would report a 20% code as ₹200 off.
