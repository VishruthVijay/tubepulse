 * HERE. The browser opens Razorpay's checkout with this id, the customer
 * authorises the autopay mandate there, and the webhook tells us it happened.
 *
 * Two guards, and both matter with live keys:
 *   1. Signed in. An anonymous checkout has no user to grant the tier to.
 *   2. Not already paying. Razorpay will cheerfully create a second mandate on
 *      the same card, and the customer would be charged twice a month.
 *
 * The body names a PLAN, a CYCLE and optionally a CODE. It never names a price
 * — the amount comes from the Razorpay plan object, and the discount is
 * re-validated here rather than trusted from whatever the preview told the
 * browser.
