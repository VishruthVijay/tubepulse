# Deploying TubePulse

Domain: **tube-pulse.org**, registered at **Cloudflare** (a different Cloudflare
account, not the one this deploy runs from — DNS edits happen there). Host is
Vercel. GitHub is public at `VishruthVijay/tubepulse`; a second machine deploys
by forking that repo into its own GitHub account and importing the fork into
Vercel.

**Razorpay approved `vidhyaforher.com`, not this domain.** A new website on the
account is submitted under Account & Settings → Website and app settings and
reviewed in roughly 1–2 business days. Everything except paid checkout works the
moment DNS resolves, so deploy first and let the approval land behind you — but
do not promise anyone a working Go Pro button until it does.

Nothing in the code contains the domain. Changing it again means five settings
and no commits: Vercel `APP_URL`, Vercel Domains, Cloudflare DNS, the Supabase
URL configuration and the Razorpay webhook.

Do these in order. Steps 1 and 2 can be done now; the rest need the site to
actually be live at the domain.

A click-by-click version for a non-engineer, written for doing all of this from
a second machine with only a browser, is published at
<https://claude.ai/code/artifact/f4849507-1cce-4a97-ae6d-996ef0a65802>.

## 0. Get the code onto the new laptop's accounts

The code, GitHub account, Vercel account and Cloudflare account involved here
are four different logins across two machines. Order matters because Vercel
needs a repo to import before it needs env vars.

1. **On this machine:** push everything to `main` on
   `github.com/VishruthVijay/tubepulse` (already the origin). The repo is
   public, so no invite is needed for the next step.
2. **On the new laptop, in the new GitHub account:** open
   `github.com/VishruthVijay/tubepulse` and click **Fork**. This copies the
   repo (not the secrets — `.env.local` is git-ignored and was never in the
   repo) into the new account.
3. **In the new Vercel account:** **Add New → Project**, choose **Import Git
   Repository**, authorize Vercel's GitHub App for the new account if asked,
   and pick the fork. Leave build settings on their Next.js defaults.
4. **Before the first deploy finishes being useful,** paste the environment
   variables (step 3 below) into that same import screen, or add them under
   **Settings → Environment Variables** and redeploy — a build with no env
   vars will succeed but the app will be non-functional.
5. `.env.local` itself has to cross machines some other way — it is
   git-ignored on purpose and cannot come from GitHub. Send it over anything
   you already trust with the Razorpay live keys (a password manager's secure
   note, AirDrop, a private message to yourself) — never a commit, an issue,
   or a public paste.

---

## 1. Run the outstanding migrations

**Five are outstanding: 0010, 0011, 0012, 0013, 0014.** (0001-0009 were applied
before the previous deploy.)

**Paste them one at a time, not as one block.** `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` can
be rejected by Postgres with *"cannot run inside a transaction block"*, and the
Supabase SQL editor sends a pasted block as a single string.

```bash
npm.cmd run db:sql -- --only 0010   # USD pricing, promo durations
npm.cmd run db:sql -- --only 0011   # idea title variants + thumbnail concepts
npm.cmd run db:sql -- --only 0012   # per-run cost + agent trail
npm.cmd run db:sql -- --only 0013   # tiered launch promo  ** SEE BELOW **
npm.cmd run db:sql -- --only 0014   # content calendar
```

Copy each, paste into **Supabase → SQL editor → Run**, confirm success, then do
the next.

### 0013 needs TWO pastes, and this already bit us once

It adds values to two enums, and Postgres will not let a new enum value be USED
in the same transaction that created it. Run the two `alter type` lines at the
top **on their own** first:

```sql
alter type promo_duration add value if not exists 'first_two_cycles';
alter type promo_scope add value if not exists 'subscription_monthly';
```

Then run everything from `alter table public.promo_codes` to the end of the
file as the second paste. Starting the second paste too far down produces
`42703: column "tier_percents" does not exist` — which means the columns were
skipped, not that anything is broken. Re-run from the `alter table` lines.

All five are additive: nothing is dropped or renamed, and every existing row
stays valid. `add column if not exists` and `on conflict do nothing` throughout,
so a re-run is a no-op.

**If you see `42P07: relation ... already exists`,** that migration is already
applied — skip to the next one.

### Then verify

Paste `scripts/verify-schema.sql` into the SQL editor. Every row should read
`ok`; anything else names exactly what is missing. It reads the catalogue only
and changes nothing, and it confirms row-level security is on for all thirteen
tables. It covers every migration through 0014, including both of 0013's enum
values — so it will catch the case where 0013's first paste succeeded and the
second was never run.

---

## 2. Verify nothing is a placeholder

`npm run check:env` guards `.env.example` only — it has never looked at
`.env.local`. A placeholder there has already broken this app once:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` sat at `https://yourproject.supabase.co` while
`SUPABASE_URL` was correct, and Node reported it only as `fetch failed`.

Both the browser and the server read the **public** URL, so one wrong value
breaks sign-in on both sides.

---

## 3. Environment variables on the host

Copy every key from `.env.local`, with these differences:

| variable | local | production |
| -------- | ----- | ---------- |
| `APP_URL` | `http://localhost:3111` | `https://tube-pulse.org` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` | live key | same live key |

**`APP_URL` is the one that changes behaviour, not just text.** `webhooksCanReachUs()`
reads it to decide whether to hand Apify a webhook URL at all. On localhost it
sends none — Apify *rejects a run whose webhook URL it cannot reach*, which
would fail every scrape. Once `APP_URL` is a public https domain, webhooks are
sent and scrapes finish in seconds rather than waiting for the polling fallback.

`RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` must **never** gain a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix — that would
ship it in the JavaScript bundle.

Keys are already **live** (`rzp_live_…`). A production build refuses to start on
test keys, deliberately: shipping test keys live looks perfect and earns nothing.

**Editing a variable on Vercel does nothing to the deployment already serving
traffic.** They are baked in at build time, so every env fix needs a Redeploy
(Deployments → ⋯ → Redeploy, cache off). A corrected `APP_URL` that was never
redeployed looks identical to one that was never corrected.

### DNS at Cloudflare

Add `tube-pulse.org` in Vercel → Settings → Domains first, choosing to redirect
`www` to the bare domain, then set the records in the Cloudflare account that
owns the domain (DNS → Records). **Edit the existing records, do not add a
second copy** — two `A` records on `@` send half of all visitors to whichever
resolves first.

| type | name | value | proxy status |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ------------ |
| A | `@` | `76.76.21.21` | **DNS only** (grey cloud) |
| CNAME | `www` | `cname.vercel-dns.com` | **DNS only** (grey cloud) |

**The proxy toggle matters.** Cloudflare's default for a new record is
"Proxied" (orange cloud) — that routes traffic through Cloudflare's own edge
and its own certificate, which fights Vercel's automatic HTTPS and can leave
the site permanently on a Cloudflare error page or cert mismatch. Click the
cloud icon so it turns grey before saving each record.

Vercel prints the authoritative values on the Domains screen and occasionally
issues a project-specific CNAME target; that screen wins over this table.

Nameservers stay Cloudflare's — this is a records change, not a transfer.
Cloudflare's **SSL/TLS → Overview** mode does not need to change (Vercel issues
its own cert once the grey-cloud records resolve), and any existing MX records
should be left alone or email on the domain dies.

## 3b. Razorpay plan objects — six of them

Nothing can be bought until these exist. A Razorpay plan hard-codes BOTH its
period and its amount, so four tiers x two cycles means six plan objects (Scout
is free and has none).

```bash
npm.cmd run razorpay:plan
```

It prints six ids. Paste them into `.env.local` AND into Vercel:

| variable | tier |
| -------- | ---- |
| `RAZORPAY_PLAN_ID_CREATOR_MONTHLY` / `_YEARLY` | Creator $19 |
| `RAZORPAY_PLAN_ID_STUDIO_MONTHLY` / `_YEARLY` | Studio $49 |
| `RAZORPAY_PLAN_ID_AGENCY_MONTHLY` / `_YEARLY` | **Max** $89 |

**The AGENCY variables are Max.** The tier is displayed as "Max" but its
internal key is still `agency`, because renaming it would orphan live
subscriptions. The env names follow the key, not the label.

**Plans cannot be edited or deleted at Razorpay.** Repricing means creating new
ones and repointing the variables; existing subscribers stay on the old plan
until they resubscribe.

If the yearly ids are blank the yearly toggle simply hides — that is a
deliberate degrade, not a failure.

---

## 3c. Razorpay offers for the launch promo — six more

Only needed when you actually want `LAUNCH` / `FOUNDER` to work. Skip it to
launch without a discount; the codes refuse at checkout until it is done, which
is safe.

The codes give a different percentage per tier — Creator 30%, Studio 40%, Max
50% — and a Razorpay Offer carries one fixed discount, so each code needs three
offers. Two codes x three tiers = six.

**Every offer MUST be created with a cycle limit of 2.** An Offer attached to a
subscription applies to EVERY billing cycle unless it carries that limit, and
the dashboard does not warn you. Miss it on one offer and that tier's discount
runs forever, for everyone who used that code, and nobody notices until the
third invoice.

Then write the ids into the code rows:

```sql
update public.promo_codes
set tier_offer_ids = '{"creator":"offer_...","studio":"offer_...","agency":"offer_..."}'::jsonb,
    active     = true,
    starts_at  = '2026-09-15T00:00:00Z',
    expires_at = '2026-09-22T00:00:00Z'
where code = 'LAUNCH';
```

`max_redemptions` is already 25 on each. The app refuses any tier whose offer id
is missing rather than falling back to another one, so a partial paste fails
loudly at checkout instead of attaching the wrong discount.

---

## 4. Razorpay webhook

Razorpay cannot reach a laptop, which is why this waits for deploy.

- **URL:** `https://tube-pulse.org/api/webhooks/razorpay`
- **Secret:** the value already in `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. It is invented by
  us, not issued by Razorpay — paste the same string into their dashboard.
- **Events:** every `subscription.*`, plus `order.paid`.

`RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` also gates the BUTTONS, not just the webhook: with it
blank, `isBillingConfigured()` is false and `/billing` and `/pricing` silently
hide Go Pro. It reads as "the button is missing", never as "a variable is unset".

---

## 5. Supabase auth settings

These live in the dashboard, not in this repo:

- **Site URL:** `https://tube-pulse.org`
- **Redirect URLs:** add `https://tube-pulse.org/auth/callback` and
  `https://tube-pulse.org/**`, keeping the existing localhost entry so the dev
  machine still works

Miss these and Google sign-in returns to localhost — or nowhere.

**The Google Cloud Console needs no change.** `signInWithGoogle` sends users to
Supabase, and Google's authorised redirect URI is Supabase's own
`/auth/v1/callback`, which does not move when our domain does. The Supabase
redirect allow-list above is the only thing gating it. Note also that the
`redirectTo` is built from the request's `origin` header, so signing in through
a `*.vercel.app` preview URL fails unless that origin is allow-listed too —
test at the real domain.

SMTP must stay on **port 587**. 465 is implicit TLS, which Supabase's auth
service handles badly and free Gmail rejects outright; the only symptom is a
generic `Error sending confirmation email`.

---

## 5b. Switching transcripts on — `APIFY_TRANSCRIPT_ACTOR`

Transcripts ship SWITCHED OFF. `/transcript` renders a panel reading
"Transcripts are not switched on" and the Extract button stays disabled until
this one variable is set. That is deliberate — the actor bills per result — but
it was previously documented NOWHERE, so the only way to discover the value was
to read a comment inside `src/lib/apify/client.ts`.

```
APIFY_TRANSCRIPT_ACTOR=supreme_coder/youtube-transcript-scraper
```

That is the actor the input payload is written for: `startTranscriptRun` sends
`urls: [{ url }]`, which is that actor's schema. The other keys it sends
(`videoUrl`, `videoUrls`, `startUrls`) are aliases other transcript actors use
and are harmlessly ignored — so a DIFFERENT actor may work, but only one whose
input is one of those four shapes. Anything else returns an empty dataset and
the job finishes "successfully" with no transcript.

Cost is roughly **$0.70 per 1,000 transcripts** (pay-per-result), on top of
whatever the account's plan is. There is no free tier for it, so an Apify
account with no credit fails the run — and the error names the WEBHOOK, not the
credit, which is an hour lost to debugging the wrong thing.

Set it in `.env.local` for dev and in Vercel for production. Vercel rejects an
EMPTY env var, so leave it out entirely rather than adding it blank.

---

## 6. After the first deploy, check these three

1. **Sign in with Google.** Proves the callback and Site URL.
2. **Run one scrape.** Proves `APIFY_TOKEN`, the webhook URL, and that
   `APP_URL` is public — the job should finish without the polling fallback.
3. **Open `/billing`.** If Go Pro is missing, read the dev log line
   `[billing] Upgrade UI is HIDDEN. …` — it names the actual missing variable.
   Do not verify this by writing a script that checks the four Razorpay names:
   one was written once, reported "all set", and was wrong, because it never
   called `serverEnv()` and so never hit the throw.

---

## Known cost, per press

| action | cost |
| ------ | ---- |
| YouTube scrape, 100 videos | ~₹6 |
| Instagram scrape, 40 posts | ~₹9.50 |
| Idea generation | ~₹7.50 worst case |
| Transcript + summary | ~₹2 |

All four spend one unit of the 20-a-month allowance. See `docs/billing-setup.md`.
