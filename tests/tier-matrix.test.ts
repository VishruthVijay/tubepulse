/**
 * THE LADDER, checked as a whole rather than one feature at a time.
 *
 * The per-feature tests in plan-features.test.ts assert what each gate does.
 * This file asserts the shape of the ladder ITSELF: that it never goes
 * backwards, that the names and prices stay in order, and that no tier
 * accidentally gains or loses something in a way nobody would notice.
 *
 * That distinction matters because the failure mode here is silent. Nothing
 * about "Studio has a feature Max does not" throws, typechecks red, or gets
 * reported — a customer paying the most simply has less, and finds out on
 * their own.
